In this work, we propose an end-to-end boundary\\naware fully Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for reliable kidney and kidney\\ntumor semantic segmentation from arterial phase abdominal 3D CT scans. We\\npropose a segmentation network consisting of an encoder-decoder architecture\\nthat specifically accounts for organ and tumor edge information by devising a\\ndedicated boundary branch supervised by edge-aware loss terms. We have\\nevaluated our model on 2019 MICCAI KiTS Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge\\ndataset and our method has achieved dice scores of 0.9742 and 0.8103 for kidney\\nand tumor repetitively and an overall composite dice score of 0.8923.\""

       "AIMessage(content=\"\\n<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking how to recover from kidney stone disease. Let me start by recalling what I know about kidney stones. They are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys. Common symptoms include severe pain in the side and back, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes blood in the urine. \\n\\nFirst, I should outline the general approach. Treatment usually depends on the size of the stone, the type, and the patient's overall health. Small stones can often pass on their own, while larger ones may need medical intervention like lithotripsy or surgery. But since the user is asking about recovery, maybe they want to know the steps to take after a stone has been passed or treated.\\n\\nI need to mention hydration first because drinking plenty of water is crucial. The standard advice is to aim for 2-3 liters a day, maybe more if they can handle it, to help flush out the kidneys. But I should check if there are any exceptions, like if someone has heart or kidney issues where too much fluid could be harmful. Maybe add a note about consulting a healthcare provider about the right amount.\\n\\nThen, pain management. After passing a stone, there might still be some discomfort. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help, but I should remind them to follow dosage instructions and consult a doctor if unsure. Also, rest is important, so advising them to take it easy and avoid strenuous activity initially makes sense.\\n\\nDiet is another key factor. The type of kidney stone can influence dietary recommendations. For example, calcium oxalate stones might require reducing oxalate-rich foods (like spinach, nuts, chocolate) but ensuring adequate dietary calcium to prevent oxalate absorption. Uric acid stones need a low-purine diet (avoiding red meat, organ meats, shellfish). Maybe suggest a low-sodium diet as high sodium can increase calcium in urine. Also, staying away from excessive protein since that can increase uric acid production.\\n\\nLifestyle changes should include regular exercise to improve overall health and possibly reduce the risk of recurrence. Weight management is also important because obesity is a risk factor.\\n\\nPreventing recurrence is crucial. Mentioning that they should work with a healthcare provider to identify the type of stone through analysis. Then specific dietary adjustments and medications if needed, like thiazide diuretics for calcium stones or allopurinol for uric acid stones.\\n\\nMedical follow-up is important too. They should have regular check-ups to monitor kidney function and ensure no residual stones. Maybe an ultrasound or CT scan as needed.\\n\\nAlternative therapies: Some people use herbal remedies or supplements, but I should caution them to check with a doctor first to avoid interactions or kidney strain.\\n\\nWhen to see a doctor: If they experience severe pain, fever, chills (signs of infection), or if they can't pass the stone after a while. Also, if they have chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension that affect kidney health, close monitoring is necessary.\\n\\nWait, but the user might be asking about the recovery process after treatment. Maybe I should structure it step by step: immediate care, lifestyle changes, medical management, and prevention. Also, note that recovery time varies, but it's important to stay hydrated and follow the doctor's advice.\\n\\nI should also mention the importance of a follow-up appointment to ensure all stones have passed and to discuss prevention strategies. Maybe include some common dietary recommendations but emphasize personalization based on stone analysis.\\n\\nHmm, need to make sure the advice is safe and not giving medical advice beyond general guidelines. Encourage consulting a healthcare provider for personalized plans. Avoid suggesting specific medications without a prescription. Also, clarify that if symptoms persist or worsen, they should see a doctor immediately.\\n\\nLet me organize this into sections for clarity: hydration, pain management, diet, lifestyle, medical follow-up, and when to seek help. That way the user can go through each part systematically. Also, maybe a note on emotional stress and the importance of mental health during recovery.\\n\\nWait, are there any common mistakes people make during recovery? Maybe not drinking enough, or following an incorrect diet. Stress can affect recovery, so managing stress might be helpful. Also, some people might take supplements without checking, like calcium supplements if they have oxalate stones, which could be problematic. Need to mention avoiding that.\\n\\nAlso, the timeframe for recovery depends on the severity. Small stones might resolve in a few days to weeks. Larger stones treated with procedures might take longer. So it's variable, so advising patience and following medical advice.\\n\\nI think that covers the main points. Now, present it in a clear, step-by-step manner without using markdown. Make sure each section is concise and actionable. End with a reminder to consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.\\n</think>\\n\\nRecovering from kidney stone disease involves a combination of medical guidance, lifestyle adjustments, and proactive care. Here’s a structured approach to help with recovery and reduce recurrence:\\n\\n### 1. **Stay Hydrated**\\n   - **Drink plenty of fluids**: Aim for **2–3 liters (about 8–10 glasses) of water daily** to flush out the urinary system. Your doctor may recommend even more, depending on your health.\\n   - **Electrolyte drinks**: Consider diluted lemonade or cranberry juice (in moderation) as citrate in these can help prevent stone formation.\\n   - **Avoid dehydration triggers**: Limit caffeine and alcohol, which can dehydrate.\\n\\n### 2. **Manage Pain and Symptoms**\\n   - **Pain relief**: Use OTC pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen (follow dosage instructions). For severe pain, your doctor may prescribe stronger medication.\\n   - **Rest**: Take breaks from strenuous activity to allow the body to heal.\\n\\n### 3. **Dietary Adjustments**\\n   - **Personalized diet**: Work with a healthcare provider or dietitian to tailor your diet based on the stone type:\\n     - **Calcium oxalate stones**: Reduce oxalate-rich foods (spinach, nuts, beets) but maintain adequate dietary calcium (don’t avoid calcium entirely).\\n     - **Uric acid stones**: Limit high-purine foods (red meat, organ meats, shellfish) and increase fruits/vegetables.\\n     - **Struvite/calcium phosphate stones**: Reduce sodium intake.\\n   - **Limit salt**: High sodium intake increases calcium excretion.\\n   - **Moderate protein**: Excess protein can elevate uric acid and calcium levels.\\n   - **Increase fiber**: Aids in reducing stone-forming substances.\\n\\n### 4. **Medical Follow-Up**\\n   - **Stone analysis**: Ensure your stone is analyzed to identify type, guiding prevention strategies.\\n   - **Regular check-ups**: Monitor kidney function and ensure no residual stones via imaging (e.g., X-ray or ultrasound).\\n   - **Medications**: Your doctor might prescribe drugs like thiazide diuretics (for calcium stones), allopurinol (for uric acid stones), or potassium citrate to alkalinize urine.\\n\\n### 5. **Lifestyle Changes**\\n   - **Exercise**: Engage in regular, moderate activity (e.g., walking) to improve circulation and reduce stress.\\n   - **Weight management**: Maintain a healthy weight, as obesity increases recurrence risk.\\n   - **Avoid smoking**: Smoking can worsen kidney health and stone formation.\\n\\n### 6. **Monitor Symptoms and Seek Help**\\n   - **When to contact a doctor**:\\n     - Severe, persistent pain despite pain relief.\\n     - Signs of infection (fever, chills).\\n     - Difficulty urinating or blood in urine lasting more than a few days.\\n     - Recurrent stones or chronic symptoms.\\n\\n### 7. **Preventive Measures**\\n   - **Track symptoms and diet**: Keep a diary of fluid intake, diet, and symptoms to identify triggers.\\n   - **Avoid fad diets/supplements**: Some supplements (e.g., vitamin C, calcium) can worsen stones if not monitored.\\n\\n### 8. **Emotional Well-Being**\\n   - **Manage stress**: Stress can indirectly impact kidney health. Practices like meditation or yoga may help.\\n\\n### Recovery Timeline:\\n- Small stones may pass within days to weeks. Recovery from medical procedures (e.g., lithotripsy) may take 1–2 weeks, but this varies based on treatment and individual health.\\n\\n### Key Takeaway:\\nRecovery is individualized. Always consult your healthcare provider for a tailored plan, especially regarding medication and diet. Prevention is critical—adhering to a personalized strategy can significantly reduce recurrence risk.\\n\\nIf you experience sudden severe pain, inability to urinate, or signs of infection, seek immediate medical attention.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1794, 'prompt_tokens': 17, 'total_tokens': 1811, 'completion_time': 4.383805692, 'prompt_time': 0.003101418, 'queue_time': 0.0014956760000000005, 'total_time': 4.38690711}, 'model_name': 'qwen-qwq-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_fbb7e6cc39', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-e96664d0-b891-436d-a68b-0321c9a43739-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 17, 'output_tokens': 1794, 'total_tokens': 1811})"

      "convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best\n",

      "solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\n",
      "entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be\n",
      "superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\n",

      "BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction\n",
      "of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the\n",

      "   - **Political Debates**: Congress continues debating potential cuts, with implications for programs like Medicaid and Medicare telehealth coverage (some Medicare beneficiaries fear losing access to virtual care services).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Healthcare Accessibility and Equity**  \n",
      "   - **Medicare Drug Caps**: Medicare’s $2,000 annual cap on insulin costs is providing relief to diabetes patients, while negotiations for broader prescription drug price caps (including weight-loss and cancer drugs) are ongoing.  \n",

      "\n",
      "### 4. **Emerging Medical Trends**  \n",
      "   - **Gene Therapy vs. Weight-Loss Drugs**: Investors are shifting focus from gene therapy to weight-loss drugs (e.g., Ozempic) due to faster ROI, potentially slowing progress in genetic medicine.  \n",
      "   - **Telehealth in Pediatrics**: A study found that telehealth visits for children reduced unnecessary antibiotic use for respiratory infections.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Policy and Governance**  \n",
      "   - **HHS Layoffs**: The Department of Health and Human Services faced criticism for improper layoffs of ~10,000 workers, with legal challenges ongoing.  \n",
      "   - **State-Level Actions**: Some states are expanding mental health resources, while others face backlash for restricting transgender youth healthcare access.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Takeaways:  \n",
      "- **Cuts to federal funding** threaten Medicaid and Medicare services, affecting vulnerable populations.  \n",
